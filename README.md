Download the game at:

How to run the game:

Open the P3 folder and open up index.html





How to Play:

Move the player (using the arrow keys) to collect the key and the gem in the level
to open the door to the next level. Be careful not to get hit by the enemies! =)

_Note: Since there is currently only one level to this game, collecting the gem and key and moving to the door will reset
the player to the default starting position. I have two additional levels planned for this game that will be added in the near
future. Happy playing! =)_
